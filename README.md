## Main Projects Website

This is my project's github repo site.

<br/>

This is created solely for maintaining various projects/apps -and their documentation- and does not serve any other personal purpose.

<br/>

Entire website has __been setup in a hurry using only plain-text editor__ (notepad) and will be further improved in the near future with more projects and content to come..
